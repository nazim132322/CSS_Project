                <p>Ace debater, artist and writer: Head Girl
                    Sanchi shouldered her responsibility with
                    aplomb. A ‘never say die’ attitude defined
                    her as she believes Don’t stop when you are
                    tired. Stop when you are done. Cognizant
                    of the fact that with great power comes
                    great responsibility she donned the mantle
                    of the role model with grace. She was
                    someone who could always be counted upon
                    to help each Ecolier be the best version of
                    herself. Incisive wit and a penetrating
                    mind are her tools for her chosen career
                    path of becoming the best Corporate
                    Lawyer.</p>
                    <p>Probably when someone said all good
                    things come in small packages, he had
                    Sanchi in mind.</p>
